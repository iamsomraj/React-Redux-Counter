# React-Redux-Counter

React-Redux-Counter repository contains a basic counter. But, here I have utilized redux for the state management. I have used two separate reducers with the action types and action creators. I have used Middleware with the help of the package called Redux Thunk. Also, I have created my own logger middleware by seeing the documentation from Redux website.

## Objectives

1. Using  createStore, combineReducers, applyMiddleware, compose from redux
2. Using a timeout on the show result button with redux thunk package
3. Used separate reducers for the counterReducers and resultReducers
4. Implemented action creators and action types

## Contents

1. RDBMS
2. Case Study 1
3. HTML CSS JavaScript
